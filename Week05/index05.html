    <div class="col-sm-9"> 
      <p>This week we were tasked with designing a small 3-D object that could not be easily created using subtractive methods and that would take less than an hour to print. I wanted to create something that had movable parts because I was curious about how the 3-D printer creates things like hinges that can’t be disassembled. Again, inspired by our cat, my husband suggested a small catapult that could propel her toys or treats around the room.</p>
      <p>I considered designing something that wouldn’t require the use of a rubber band, but since I’ve never 3-D printed anything and have limited experience with the pliability of the filament material, I thought it might be best not to tempt fate.</p>
      <p>I drafted a few ideas on graph paper and then used Fusion 360 to make my design. I did my best to limit the amount of material I used to create the structure, while still making sure it would be structurally viable. I also wanted to design the structure so that I wouldn't need any supports for the printing process. My original design in Fusion360 measured at roughly 10cm square.</p>
      <p><iframe src="https://myhub.autodesk360.com/ue2f9e3f6/shares/public/SH56a43QTfd62c1cd96878c06e439bcfed80?mode=embed" width="800" height="600" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
      <p>I exported the completed design to PrusaSlicer and making no changes to the automatic infill percent (20%) and keeping the size at 100%, the slicer computed a print time of a whopping 5 hours and 18 minutes! Changing the infill percentage didn't make too much of a difference (minutes) so I adjusted the size. Dropping it to 50% put my print time at 57minutes. Phew! This will be a wee catapult, but I guess that will just make it very very cute.</p>
      <p>While I think the frame could have been made using subtractive methods, the bucket and arm portion of the catapult are more easily made using additive methods. Plus, the hinge that connected the two together could not have been made using subtractive methods, unless the two pieces were cut separately and the hinge mechanism adjusted so that it could be put together and taken back apart.</p>

    <p>I experimented with a few 3-D scanner apps, but since I have an older phone, I was limited. Plus, the apps meant for iphoneX seemed to be mostly for face scanning, which I didn't want to do. I ended up using <a href="https://www.qlone.pro/">Qlone</a> to scan as it was the only app I was able to get working (unfortunatley Scan3D crashed when I tried to load it). I visited my parents this weekend (the first time I'd seen them since September!!) and decided to take advantage of their resources -- a lazy susan, and a variety of tchotchkes. Continuing with the cat theme, I chose a small porcelain figurine of a white kitten because it was (a) small and (b) I wanted to see how the 3-D scanner would pick up its textured fur.</p>
    <p>Scanning with the lazy susan really made the process much more pleasant than my earlier experiments walking around objects. The initial scan of the object had a very pointy top,  a trait that seems to be common to the Qlone app. Selecting "flatten top" overcompensated, so instead I took advantage of another feature of the app. Qlone allows you to take scans of the object in multiple positions to improve the scan. I took a second scan of the cat on its side and this produced a much better composite scan.</p>
    <p>A major downside to Qlone is that while you can make scans for free and export them as GIFs, Videos, or Images, you have to pay to export any other filetypes.</p>

    <p>As I am making a glove, I don't anticipate needing to 3-D print anything. Instead, I did some research on conductive thread and different wearable sensors and wearable inventions generally. I ordered some conductive thread to experiment with and along the way discovered that conductive yarn also exists. I may play around with that as well, as crocheting a finger pad may be easier than embroidering one.</p>
