  <p><b>The Idea</b></p>
  <p><a href="https://erikschreiner.github.io/PHYSCI-70/">Erik Schreiner</a> and I paired up to design a press-fit construction kit. We decided it would be good to come up with a design that involved two pieces that had to fit together in some way, and that each of those two pieces should also have components that needed to fit together. After some ruminating, I sought some inspiration from the LEGO Star Wars page and there it was - an Imperial TIE Fighter - an assemblage of two hexagons and a sphere. Erik designed the cockpit (sphere) and I design the wings (hexagons) and we came up with a way to join the pieces together. We agreed on a baseline cockpit diameter that could be our constant when establishing parameters. I estimated the ratios of the various parts of the TIE Fighter using my caliper and an <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/new-star-wars-book-teaches-you-how-to-fly-a-tie-fighter/">image from the internet</a> (yes, I held the calipers up to the screen, but it worked).</p>
  <p><b>Wing Design</b></p>
  <p>For the wings I came up with the following dimensions:<br>
      Wing height (top to bottom) = 4*cockpit diameter<br>
      Center wing width = 0.8 * wing height<br>
      Top & Bottom wing width = 0.6 x wing height<br></p>
  <p>I estimated that each of the two tapered connectors was about 1.8 times the cockpit diameter (this turned out to be wrong, but in the end, Erik and I decided to leave the length of the connectors as is). We decided to make the connectors as two interlocking notched pieces, and we would design the connections to our respective components using tabs on the ends of the connectors. We each designed our tab connections differently.</p>

      <img src="ConnectorDimensions.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
    </div>
  </div>
<p>I did a lot of drawing and estimating on graph paper before working in Fusion 360, just to work out my measurements and to configure how my half of the tapered connector would attach to the wing. I also knew I wanted the wing to be more than a mere hexagon, to capture some of the geometry of the actual TIE Fighter design.</p>
<p>I decided to borrow a design for joints from a Fab Academy project by <a href="https://fabacademy.org/archives/2014/students/diazdeleon.alejandra/3.Laser%20Cut.html">Alejandra Díaz de León Lastras</a>. I had to do some clever kerf math to make sure that the joint connectors would fit snugly in the tab opening (and to make sure the tab would fit snugly in the central holes of the wing layers.</p>

<p><b>Assembling components using joints</b></p>
<p>I did a few battles with Fusion 360 to get the various components of the wing and the tapered connector to assemble. At this point, I decided to combine the second assignment of the week (work through a Fusion 360 Tutorial and document your learning) with the press-fit construction kit assignment.</p>
<p>I worked through this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw08O6XsfDI">joint tutorial</a> using my own TIE Fighter Wing components in place of the components in the tutorial.</p>
<p>Using the “ground” function to lock my large wing layer into place was key. Before this, my pieces were just floating around space willy nilly. From there I had to figure out how to join the second and third wing layers to the large wing layer, but each time I selected join and select the planes of the components, I ended up with absurd joins. Joining using a corner could work for the first two wing layers, but it wouldn’t work for the smaller third wing layer. Luckily, the tutorial covered this as well. Like the components in the tutorial, my components had holes through their middles. I needed these holes (identical on each component) to line up so that my tab connector could be inserted through them. I learned from the tutorial that as I hover over a plane, if I press “command” then I would be able to hover to the center point and select that center point. This enabled me to join each of my components around that center point. Phew!</p>

    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <img src="PoorJoin.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Image">

      <img src="TabConnectorJoin2.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
    </div>
  </div>

<p>The next step was getting the tab connector to insert into the three conjoined wing components. But having viewed the tutorial, I had learned that I can select edges and corners in addition to planes to make joins. So I selected the edges of the tab connector and the large wing layer on and this caused the tab connecter to join but at an angle. I merely had to adjust the angle slightly and the tab connector inserted perfectly. I performed a similar join action on the two joint pieces. And voila! I had an assembled wing.</p>

<p><b>The Actual Assembly</b></p>

<p>Erik and I shared our Fusion 360 files with each other, but besides discussing dimensions and agreeing on a connection method, we didn’t edit each other’s designs. Check out <a href="https://erikschreiner.github.io/PHYSCI-70/">Erik’s documentation of his cockpit design here</a>. We sent off our DXF files to Nathan to be printed. I picked up the laser cut kit on Monday and Erik and I zoomed to assemble it.</p>

<p>Erik instructed me on how to assemble the cockpit. Unfortunately, the joints weren’t quite tight enough, so we resorted to some tape to help the assembly along. Once the pieces of the cockpit were safely in place around the wing connectors, I assembled the wings. I was concerned that I’d have a similar loose problem with my tab and lock connectors, but they turned out to be a nice snug fit. Our connectors slide together like butter, and we had a TIE Fighter!</p>

<p>To celebrate I did a little photo op with some Star Wars celebrities.</p>

<div class="container-fluid bg-7">
  <p>Since I’m still learning what everything is in the kit, I decided to model something that I could tell what it was: a LEGO wheel, a LEGO tire, and a wee LEGO axle. First, I measured the dimensions of the wheel using my handy dandy calipers:<br>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6"> 
    <p>Outside Rim - outer diameter: 16.91mm (also the total diameter)
  <br>Outside Rim width: 0.25mm
  <br>Inside Rim - outer diameter: 7.10mm
  <br>Inside Rim width: 0.25mm
  <br>Inner circle diameter: 4.15mm
  <br>Wheel Height: 15.22mm
  <br>and on and on...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <img src="KitItems.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
    </div>
    
</div>
  

<p>Unfortunately, some of the elements of the wheel were just too tiny for my calipers, like the slight taper between the bottom and middle parts of the wheel… so I decided to estimate...</p>

<p><b>On to the TIRE...</b>So the rubber is PLIANT, which means I needed to be careful when measuring. I did make some preliminary measurements, but after beginning to model the wheel, I quickly realized that I was NOT going to be able to model the tire... so I settled for modeling just the wheel and the axle.</p>

<p>I designed the wheel sketch so that I could extrude all of the various parts from the same sketch. I then extruded the bodies in segments and joined them together. The one piece I hadn’t figured out was how to add the little notch in the side of the wheel. We'll come back to that later.</p>
<p>I then moved on to the axle. I drew two sketches within the same sketch, extruded each piece in portions and then joined them together. To extrude the notched cylindrical piece, I extruded it as multiple bodies and joined them together. I then assembled the two components and joined them using a cylindrical join, which I could then animate. Yay!</p>

<p>But, I was still bothered by the missing notch on the side of the wheel. After experimenting with cutting faces and offsetting, I decided the best course of action would be to add lines to my sketch (extending the diameter of the inner circle out to the the rest of the sketch) and re-extrude the bottom middle segment. After this, I also wanted to makes sure that the two middle discs also had their little notch feature, so instead of chamfering the pieces themselves, I extruded a new disc at 0.5mm that included the notched out end and then chamfered that piece. I set the chamfer to 0.5mm so it created this nice angled edge. I then created two separate components out of the same body, and joined these chamfered discs to the bottom and middle discs. To adjust for this extra “length” in the wheel, I shorted the thick middle connecting pieces of the wheel by about 0.5mm each (which overall, made my measurements more accurate than when I chamfered the original discs themselves). Then I rejoined all the pieces of the wheel. I combined the various bodies of each component at this point, so that each piece (axle and wheel) would stay together. Finally, I updated my assembly file and re-animated the join!</p>
