  <p><b>The Idea</b></p>
  <p>I had grand ideas to make a cat toy for my fur baby Professor Meowmeow Fuzzypants (aka "Kitty"). I spent a long time thinking about a contraption that would mimic some of her favorite games - for example, she loves to play "hunt the stick" through a blanket (she is a weird cat). Anyway, I ended up envisioning a school of fish swimming back and forth. </p>

  <p><b>Actualization</b></p>
  <p>I spent a lot of time thinking about how to create the kind of movement I wanted. I knew I needed to convert radial motion into linear motion (preferably reciprocating motion as I wanted the fish to swim back and forth. I considered a few different set ups including a scotch yoke, but decided that the best way to get the back and forth motion I wanted was to make a slider crank like this one below.</p><br>

  <p>I knew that the sliding mechanism would move the distance of the diameter of the circle, and I wanted the back and forth movement to be large, as the fish would be wiggling back and forth through a curved track (in the ideal scenario). I decided the best way to figure out how it would actually fit together was to do some prototyping.</p><br>
  <p>I inherited my mother's disdain for throwing anything away, and thus I already had a nice stash of cardboard and styrofoam as well as miscellaneous plastic and tin items. My husband has a stellar collection of screws and bolts and other hardware, which was also a great resource. My local Buy Nothing group hooked me up with a stash of wire hangers. All that plus a hot glue gun (or 2), some disposable chopsticks, and a bolt cutter and I was ready to go. </p><br>

  <p>I had some mishaps trying to create cardboard gears and spent WAY TOO LONG measuring and drawing little gear teeth and cutting it out only to learn that it just was not going to work. But then, I realized that I had a strip of corrugation that I could use as the gear teeth. The size of my large gear was determined by the length of corrugation I had. I traced out 3 identically sized circles using a mixing bowl, glued those together and then glued the corrugation to the outside. I also made a smaller gear that would be attached to the motor, since all my tests with motor speed were just too fast for the mechanism I wanted. I knew if I used a smaller gear on the motor to move the larger gear that ran the crank that I could slow the overall speed of the fish down and also magnify the force of the motor.</p>

<p>I made a base for the mechanism out of a cardboard box and scavenged materials for my levers from the kit. I fussed over how best to connect all the pieces when I realized I could use the coat hangers to be both a frame for the fish AND the connecting post to the lever mechanism. I carved a track into the box base and lined it with tape to make for a smooth ride. I used hot glue and washers to act as stoppers on the wire around the track. I used the chopsticks as wooden dowls to attach the lever to the large gear. After testing the track it was obvious that I needed another layer of support around my wire frame before I could even think about a curvy path. I also realized that I was not going to be getting three wavy paths out of this and settled for three fish in a row.</p>

<p>After some trial and error and realizing that the motor was encountering too much friction, I decided to add a wheel mechanism, rip off the curved top, and settle for dangling fish.</p><br>
<p>Unfortunately, I continued to have issues with my motor not being able to push the mechanism. So for now, it is human-powered. Alas. </p>
