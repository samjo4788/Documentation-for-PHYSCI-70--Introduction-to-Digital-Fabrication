    <p>In lab this week, I decided to create a silicon mold of Tom Servo, a character from <a href="https://mst3k.com/">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a>. I bought my husband a figurine of Tom Servo and his counterpart Crow T. Robot for our Christmas tree, but all year round they live next to our TV. The premise of the show is that an evil scientist is torturing the two robots and a human friend by forcing them to watch terrible movies. The trio manages to survive by providing humorous commentary.</p>
    <p>Based on the size of the figurine, I decided I probably only had enough material to make a one-part mold. Just in case I ended up with extra silicone, I prepared a second item: a stormtrooper helmet.</p>
    <p>I prepared the container for my mold using an empty Annie's Mac & Cheese box because I thought the plastic coating on the cardboard would help with removing the mold from the box. I also tested Tom Servo's buoyancy with water and he sunk right to the bottom (no surprise there), so I rigged up some supports with extra cardboard and the dowels from the kit so that he would float in the silicone.</p> 
    <p>The process for creating the mold was fairly straightforward:<br>
      (1) Pour out the substance from bottle B and stir it up a bit.<br>
      (2) Add the substance from bottle A and stir for 2â€“3 minutes.<br>
      (3) Pour into the mold encasing.<br></p>
    <p>It turned out that my encasing for Tom was a little too large, AND that he was very buoyant in the mixture, so I quickly adjusted the size of the box using more Annie's mac and cheese box remnants and flattened my cardboard supports. I definitely did not have extra material for a stormtrooper helmet mold!</p>

    <p>The silicone was definitely messy, and next time I'll be sure to have a trash can nearby and a bottle of rubbing alcohol, because naturally I managed to get the uncured silicone all over my hands multiple times.<p>
    <p>The mold took a while to cure. It is supposed to take at least 4 hours, and I let mine sit overnight. In the morning, though, when I removed Tom, there was still some uncured material on his belly area, so I let it cure for the rest of the next day. Then I made a Tom Servo ice cube, colored with a little bit of food coloring! Unfortunately, his arms weren't quite submerged enough to get a deep enough mold, and thus they were very weak. Nevertheless, he made a great scotch on the rocks, and his yellow tinge gave the drink a nice golden color.</p>
