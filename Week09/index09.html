    <p>Our in-class tutorial to set up the firebase/huzzah communications really piqued my interest in Firebase capabilities. I'm not sure that I will need to use it for my final project just yet, but I certainly want to explore it further in later weeks. For now (and knowing my track record for time spent learning how to do things in this class), I wanted to adjust the code from this tutorial to make a web-app for interacting with our cat.</p>
    <p>My initial idea was to create a treat dispenser. Of course, we do have one of thes (a Pawbo) but obviously our cat needs more treats and it would be nice to have them available in more than one place in the house when we aren't around. I also thought it could be fun for members of the class to be able to send her a treat. However, I quickly realized that I did not have the time to fabricate the actual treat dispensing set up. I did take apart our Pawbo, but it wasn't obvious how I could rewire it without destroying it.</p>
    <p>Instead, I decided to finally mess around with the servo motors and make a motorized cat toy that could be controlled with a web app. I wanted this to be more than a simple "on/off." The final iteration will give you the ability to "twitch," "swing" or "turn off" the toy.</p>

      <p>I started at the beginning with servos, using our <h ref="https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Networking/networking/USART/index.html">class page tutorial and code on using a Huzzah32 with a servo motor</a>. Naturally, I ran into a couple issues because I didn't have the ESP32Servo library installed, but that was easy to figure out once Arduino IDE told me there was an error with my library.</p>
      <p>Next I created the the different "moves" that I would want the toy to make. Obviously, the servo motor only goes 180 degrees, but based on my previous experiences with cat toys that involve semi-elastic strings, you don't need to move it too much to make it move continously. I expected that the "swinging" motion would actually create a cyclical pattern. For my "twitch" movement the servo would move just 45 degrees and back to 0 at a quick and uneven rate; for the "swing" the servo would move 180 degrees and back, at a slower but even rate.</p>

  <div class="col-sm-9">
    <p>First I needed to make sure I could turn the servo on and off using Firebase, though. So I modified the code from our LED exercise. At first, I had problems compiling. I kept getting the error "myservo not declared in scope." I wasted about an hour googling, trying to figure out what was going on with my library until I realized that I had forgotten to include the very basic line "Servo myservo;" Seriously, I wanted to bang my head against the desk. </p>
    <p>My basic code to turn the servo on and off worked, so I attached the servo to a cat toy and experimented with different movement directions. To maximize the motion of the string toy, I attached a straw to the servo motor. For some reason, the twitching was quite irregular, and I am guessing this has to do with putting strain on the motor? In terms of cat toys, however, this is a plus. The code below is what I ended up with:</p>
    <p><pre><code class="language-arduino">

      void loop() {

  Firebase.get(firebaseData, "/SERVO_STATUS");          
  // get led status input from firebase
  fireString = firebaseData.stringData();                        // change to e.g. intData() or boolData()
  Serial.println(fireString);
  
  if (fireString == "TWITCH") {                    // compare the input of servo status received from firebase
    Serial.println("ServoCat Twitch");
    myservo.write(0);
    delay(15);
    myservo.write(45);
    delay(15);

  }

  else if (fireString == "SWING") {
    Serial.println("ServoCat Swing");
     for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1) { // goes from 0 degrees to 180 degrees
    // in steps of 1 degree
    myservo.write(pos);              // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
    delay(15);                       // waits 15ms for the servo to reach the position
  }
    for (pos = 180; pos >= 0; pos -= 1) { // goes from 180 degrees to 0 degrees
    myservo.write(pos);              // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
    delay(15);                       // waits 15ms for the servo to reach the position
  }
  }

  else if (fireString == "OFF") {              // compare the input of servo status received from firebase
    Serial.println("ServoCat OFF");
 
  }


  else {
    Serial.println("Please send ON/OFF");
  }
}

      </code></pre></p>

      <p> As usual, the cat has mixed interest. She was pretty indifferent to the twitch feature, but seemed curious about the swing. She didn't attempt to play, however.</p>

      <p> The next step is to make this a web-app, so all y'all can play with the cat. I followed the tutorial on our class Firebase page and modified the web-app button and call code. At first the web-app wasn't communicating with the Firebase, but some troubleshooting help from Nathan and Victoria solved the issue. I had left out a key line of code that referenced the firebase library AND I needed to make sure that the library versions matched. I'll keep this thing plugged in and attached to the kitchen table for as long as I can (aka until the other members of my household revolt). Enjoy!</p>
