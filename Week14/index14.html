<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<div class="container-fluid bg-7 text-center">
  <p>My final project relates directly to my dissertation research on Irish dancers and the unique (and very musical) ways that they learn, remember, and communicate their dance steps. One technique that dancers use is hand dancing: dancers use their hands or fingers to mimic complex footwork choreography. The goal of this project was to create a pair of gloves that would collect movement information that could then be analyzed and manipulated to examine parameters such as rhythmicity, style, and which could be visualized in a way that can communicate this movement behavior independent of the use of video. The DanceGlove measures whole hand movements and proximity between the left and right hands (using IMU and Photoresistive sensors), and it also measures fine motor movements of the index and middle fingers on the right hand (using flex sensors and a circuit switch).

    <p>ASSEMBLE THE GLOVE</p>
    </div>
  <div class="col-sm-9">
    <p>Follow this method for making patterns and constructing gloves for the right and left hands. Or, buy gloves. If you do the latter, you’ll need to attach two channels of elastic fabric to the index and middle fingers of the right hand.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-3">
    <p>SEW THE FINGER PADS</p>
    </div>
  <div class="col-sm-9">
    <p>On the right hand glove only there are three finger pads. Put on your glove and hold the index and middle fingers against the thumb in a pinching fashion. Note where the fingers touch. Mark these with a piece of tape and remove the glove.</p>
    <p>There are many ways to create finger pads. <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Etextile-VR-Gloves-for-Vive-Tracker/">This tutorial</a> is useful if you want to make finger pads from conductive fabric. My method will explain how to do this using crochet and embroidery of conductive thread. In both cases, the finger pads will be attached to the glove as appliqué.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-3">
        <p><b>Crochet the two finger pads:</b></p>
      </div>
      <div class = "col-sm-9">
        <p>These two pads are smaller than the thumb. You will create each the same, so do this twice. Using 2-ply conductive thread, draw a length of thread and quadruple it. Take the four strands of thread and loosely spin them together. This will serve as your “yarn”. With a crochet hook, crochet a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yNj1ZGy0PA">magic loop</a> of 7 stitches and then single crochet 1 round. Add rounds if you need a larger finger pad. Finish by pulling the strand through the last loop and using a needle to weave in the ends. Trim. Note: Cut conductive thread with sharp scissors to mitigate fraying.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-3">
        <p><b>Embroider the thumb pad:</b></p>
      </div>
      <div class = "col-sm-9">
        <p>Because the thumb pad is larger than the finger pads, it was easier for me to embroider the pad. Using a scrap piece of cotton fabric that is larger than what you need for the finger pad, trace the size of the finger pad you need to cover the thumb with a pencil on the fabric. This will be your guide for the shape of the finger pad. I recommend this be a rectangular shape to be sure that it meets both the index and middle finger, with room for moving about (your fingers won’t hit your thumb in the same place every time). Starting on the left side, embroider a row of stitches using the <a href="https://youtu.be/HjoODQJiwk0">satin stitch</a>, then continue in the other direction to make a second row. Repeat this until you have four rows, or the number of rows you need to cover the area of the finger pad (you’ll see my satin stitches aren’t particularly neat or the same size, but that doesn’t matter as long as they touch and cover the area). When the area of the pad is covered, sew into the satin stitch and trim the tail. Trim the cotton fabric around the finger pad. It may fray a bit, but don’t worry. </p>

        <p><b>Appliqué the finger pads:</b></p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-9">
        <p>Replace the tape that you attached to your glove with the appropriate finger pad and hold in place with a pin or two. Insert a thimble into the finger tip you plan to sew and use that to push the needle against. Attach the finger pad to the finger tip using the satin stitch, stitching the edge of the finger pad to the glove fabric. Do this for each of the two finger pads and the thumb pad.</p>

    <p>CREATE THE MICROCONTROLLER BASES</p>
    </div>
  <div class="col-sm-9">
    <p>Create the fabric base:<ol>
      <li>Cut four 5.5cm x 8 cm pieces of cotton fabric (on the grain) and two 2.5cm x 5cm pieces of felt or batting.</li>
      <li>Center each felt piece on a piece of cotton and sew a basting stitch down the middle to keep the felt pieces in place.</li>
      <li>For each pair of cotton pieces, place wrong sides together and pin (the felt should be facing out).</li>
      <li>Stitch around the edge using a machine, leaving one of the short ends open and being careful not to stitch over the felt. </li>
      <li>Flip each piece inside out.</li>
      <li>Fold the edges of the open end in and stitch to close.</li>
      </ol></p>

    <p>Attach to the gloves:<ol>
      <li>Put on each glove and carefully mark with pins where the corners of your square pillow will need to be placed.</li>
      <li>Remove glove and stretch over a piece of cardboard or a cup and pin the pillow in place.</li>
      <li>Hand stitch using pillow to the glove using the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_wVC84UmM">backstitch</a>.</li>

  <div class="col-sm-3">
    <p>ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED</p>
    </div>
  <div class="col-sm-9">
    <p><ul>Proximity sensor
      <li>While the proximity sensor was useful for collecting data for the machine learning component, it unfortunately did not provide the intended results for indicating which hand was “leading”. This was because of the microcontroller placement. One solution Ould be adjust the microcontroller placement on the glove to take advantage of this sensor. Another solution would be to add a photo resistive sensor to one of the fingers on each hand.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><ul>Durability
      <li>Durability was a major issue for me throughout this process. Every time I used the right hand glove, I usually damaged it. The primary issue was the the 30AWG wire was breaking off just before the solder joins. I believe that this is a combination of issues. The first is that the 30AWG wire was significantly more flexible than the solder joints, thus it had much greater freedom of movement and this put strain on the wire at the join point. The second is that the wire was so thin that it cannot withstand much twisting. A third issue was that my heat shrink was not quite the right diameter to shrink to the 30AWG size. In the future, I would use stranded wire and a tighter insulation method (electrical tape seemed to work for my repairs, stabilizing the point where the wire meets the soldered joint).</li></p>

    <p>MACHINE LEARNING</p>
    </div>
  <div class="col-sm-9">
    <p>Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to learn about and experiment with a machine learning model. I realized as I was working on the coding aspect of the project that this would have to be something I commit serious time to going forward. It will be exciting to see the possibilities!</p>
